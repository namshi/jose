This library provides a lightweight
implementation of the JWS
([JSON Web Signature](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jones-json-web-signature-04)) specification.

## Prerequisites

This library needs PHP 5.3+ and the library OpenSSL.

It has been tested using `PHP5.3` to `PHP5.6` and `HHVM`.


## Installation

You can install the library directly from
composer / [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/namshi/jose):

```
"namshi/jose": "1.0.*"
```

## Usage

Using it is pretty straightforward:
imagine that you want to offer a service
the ability to authenticate a user via
a cookie, and the service is built with
javascript; what you would need to do is
to generate a JWS (after verifying the
credentials once), store it as a cookie
and then pass it from your JavaScript app
everytime you want to authenticate that
user.

First, generate the JSW:

``` php
<?php

use Namshi\JOSE\JWS;

if ($username == 'correctUsername' && $pass == 'ok') {
	$user = Db::loadUserByUsername($username);

	$jws  = new JWS('RS256');
	$jws->setPayload(array(
		'uid' => $user->getid(),
	));

    $privateKey = openssl_pkey_get_private("file://path/to/private.key", self::SSL_KEY_PASSPHRASE);;
    $jws->sign($privateKey)
    setcookie('identity', $jws->getTokenString());
}
```

Then your JS app can use the available cookie to execute
authenticated calls, without sending passwords or credentials.

Once a request is submitted, you only have to verify that it
is a valid call:

``` php
<?php

use Namshi\JOSE\JWS;

$jws        = JWS::load($_COOKIE['identity']);
$public_key = openssl_pkey_get_public("/path/to/public.key");

// verify that the token is valid and had the same values
// you emitted before while setting it as a cookie
if ($jws->isValid($public_key)) {
	$payload = $jws->getPayload();

	echo sprintf("Hey, my JS app just did an action authenticated as user #%s", $payload['id']);
}
```

## Under the hood

In order to [validate the JWS](https://github.com/namshi/jose/blob/master/src/Namshi/JOSE/JWS.php#L126),
the signature is first [verified](https://github.com/namshi/jose/blob/master/src/Namshi/JOSE/JWS.php#L110)
with a public key and then we will check whether the [token is expired](https://github.com/namshi/jose/blob/master/src/Namshi/JOSE/JWS.php#L172).

To give a JWS a TTL, just use the standard `exp` value in the payload:

``` php
$date    	= new DateTime('tomorrow');
$this->jws  = new JWS('RS256');
$this->jws->setPayload(array(
	'exp' => $date->format('U'),
));
```
